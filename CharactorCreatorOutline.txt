The main purpose of this project is to create a web app/site that will
allow newer players to make basic characters.

The ideal outcome is to have a tool that will allow you the make 
a fully functional character in 25 to 30 minutes.
(Mechanical elements done ,role play elements can be filled out later)

Main Page: introduce the site
	"Simple Character Creator is made for new players or those who 
	want a streamlined creation tool."
	options to create account/sign in.
	some examples for basic characters?
Overview: process overview
	"There are nine steps to creating a Pathfinder character.
	This will break down each of them, and give you a better
	understanding of how they work."
Step One: Choose Class
	stick to the basic pathfinder classes
		maybe do the core classes (inquisitor, gunslinger and stuff)

Step Two: choose Ability Scores.
	pathfinder repo already has 4d6 roll set up
		pure RNG
		possible to be over/underpowered
	work on point buy system?
		easiest way would be a 20 point total
		explain point system, offer recommendations.
